# AA Notification Forwarder

Companion app for *Android Auto* to allow any apps notifications to be shown on the cars screen.

AA shows only notifications from messaging apps - but what if you want to get notified about mails and similar stuff? This is where this app comes to the rescue!

Notifications by configured apps are re-sent by *AA Notification Forwarder* and displayed on your cars screen.

### Requirements 
- Android 11 or higher
- Android Auto (duh!)

### Download
See [Releases](https://github.com/ztNFny/AANotificationForwarder/releases/new).
This will NOT be published on Google Play Store as sending non-messanger notifications to AA is not allowed.
