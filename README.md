# AA Notification Forwarder

Companion app for *Android Auto* to allow any apps notifications to be shown on the cars screen.

AA shows only notifications from messaging apps - but what if you want to get notified about mails and similar stuff? This is where this app comes to the rescue!

Notifications by configured apps are re-sent by *AA Notification Forwarder* and displayed on your cars screen.

### Requirements 
- Android 11 or higher
- Android Auto (duh!)

### Download
See [Releases](https://github.com/ztNFny/AANotificationForwarder/releases/new).
This will NOT be published on Google Play Store as sending non-messanger notifications to AA is not allowed.

### Installation
On Android 13 sideloaded apps are not able to get notification access by default. Your options:
- Sideload the app, then go to app settings dialog and enable restricted settings access from overflow menu. (see e.g. [DroidWin](https://droidwin.com/android-13-restricted-settings-for-sideloaded-apps-how-to-bypass/) for more detailed steps)
- Use apps like King Installer that pretend the app was installed from Play Store
